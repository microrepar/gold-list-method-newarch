The "Gold List Method" is a learning technique that focuses on retaining information through spaced repetition. It was developed to simplify the memorization process and make it more efficient, especially when it comes to learning a new language.

The operation of the Gold List Method is quite simple yet incredibly effective. It begins with creating a "List of Words, phrases, or expressions" in the language you want to learn, along with translations into your native language. After 15 days, following the calendar, you passively review the list, marking the words you have memorized. The words not memorized are copied to a new list for review at a future date. This process is repeated at spaced intervals of 15 days, harnessing the power of spaced repetition, a concept based on scientific research into long-term memory.

The Gold List Method is designed to help you remember words and phrases for an extended period, not just temporarily. It optimizes your study time, allowing you to memorize more with less effort. It relieves the pressure of trying to memorize everything at once, making learning more relaxed and effective. Plus, you can customize your lists to match your specific interests and needs.
